/*
 * store.js
==> 


 * apiSlice.js

==> fetchBaseQuery, createApi  : @reduxjs/toolkit/query/react
==> configureStore, createSlice: @reduxjs/toolkit



 * authSlice.js
-> in "redux" was decided that it will be the only functions which will be used for changing state
-> "actions" 
-> "reducers" talk to "store" using "useDispatch"
-> to access the "state" we need "useSelector"

> since we are dealing with backend, we will use "createApi" not "createSlice"

==> 'useDispatch, useSelector and Provider' are imported from 'react-redux'

-> whenever there is change in state, the useSelector hook gets activated.
